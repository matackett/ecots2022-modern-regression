-   Live demo + activity
-   Tips + putting it all together

# Background & Motivation

## 2014 ASA Curriculum Guidelines

. . .

"...concepts and approaches for working with **complex data**...and analyzing non-textbook data."

<br>

. . .

"...students' analyses should be undertaken in a **well-documented and reproducible way**"

<br>

. . .

"...construct effective visual displays and **compelling written summaries**" and "demonstrate ability to **collaborate in teams**..."

[Full 2014 ASA Curriculum Guidelines Report](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/edu-guidelines2014-11-15.pdf)

## Assessing final projects

-   Final group project throughout second half of the course

    -   Use regression analysis to analyze a data set of their choice
    -   Produce a written report and presentation

. . .

-   Noticed students had challenges

    -   Preparing the data for the regression model

    -   Effectively summarizing model results

    -   Making analysis decisions

# How can we help students translate conceptual knowledge to practical application?

## Inspired by introductory courses

Innovations in introductory courses in line with recommendations in the [2016 GAISE report](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf).

# Goal: Create learning experiences to continue cultivating these skills beyond the intro course

## STA 210: Regression Analysis

A course on linear and logistic regression with a focus on application.

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   **Students**: 90+ students from a range of disciplines who have taken introductory statistics, data science, or probability

-   **Class meetings**: 2 lectures with in-class activities and 1 lab

-   **Assessments**: Labs, homework, exams, final group project

## Modernizing the course

Facilitate opportunities for students to...

::: incremental
-   Regularly engage with **real-world applications and complex data**

-   Develop proficiency using **professional statistical software** and using a reproducible workflow

-   Develop important non-technical skills, specifically **written communication and teamwork**

-   Identify **appropriate methods for the primary analysis objective** - inference or prediction
:::

## Remainder of session

-   Tidymodels overview and demonstration

-   Hands-on activity with tidymodels and writing exercises

    -   **Goal:** Get a glimpse of the in-class student experience

-   Tips + putting it all together

# Computing using tidymodels

## What is tidymodels?

::: columns
::: {.column width="50%"}
The [**tidymodels**](https://www.tidymodels.org/) framework is a collection of packages for modeling and machine learning using tidyverse principles.

## Getting started with tidymodels

```{r}
#| echo: true
#| message: true

# intall.packages("tidymodels")
library(tidymodels)
```

# Live demo + activity

## Live demo + activity

-   Go to [bit.ly/modern-regression](https://bit.ly/modern-regression) and click on the **Activity** link on the left.
-   Join the RStudio Cloud workspace linked on top of the activity document.
-   Follow along!

# Tips + putting it all together

## Complex data

-   Use authentic data sets that require some wrangling
    -   Reinforces exploratory data analysis and that raw data is not always ready for analysis
    -   Extent of data wrangling differs based on type of assignment and time to complete it

. . .

-   Avoid using too many examples with violations in assumptions / regression not useful method for the data

## Resources for finding data

-   [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/)

-   [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

-   FiveThirtyEight

    -   [GitHub repo](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)

    -   [R package](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/)

-   [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)

## Teamwork

-   Teams of 3 or 4 students assigned based on
    -   statistics and computing experience
    -   major or academic interests
    -   each student has at least one potential point of connection

. . .

-   Groups work together throughout the semester on weekly lab assignments and the final project

## Teamwork

-   Teamwork is assessed based on contribution and collaboration
    -   GitHub commit history on assignments to assess contribution
    -   Periodic team feedback to assess collaboration

## Putting it all together

Some skills highlighted in 2014 ASA Curriculum Guidelines

-   "...concepts and approaches for working with complex data ...and analyzing non-textbook data."
-   "...students' analyses should be undertaken in a **well-documented and reproducible way**"
-   "...construct effective visual displays and **compelling written summaries**" and "demonstrate ability to **collaborate in teams**..."

::: question
It is important that students not only develop these skills but also how to use them in practice.
