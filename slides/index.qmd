## Assessing final projects

-   Final group project throughout second half of the course

    -   Use regression analysis to analyze a data set of their choice
    -   Produce a written report and presentation

. . .

-   Noticed students had challenges

    -   Preparing the data for the regression model

    -   Effectively summarizing model results

    -   Making analysis decisions

# How can we help students translate conceptual knowledge to practical application?

## Inspired by introductory courses

Innovations in introductory courses in line with recommendations in the [2016 GAISE report](https://www.amstat.org/docs/default-source/amstat-documents/gaisecollege_full.pdf).

Facilitate opportunities for students to...

-   Regularly engage with **real-world applications and complex data**
=======
-   Regularly engage with complex and relevant real-world data and applications

-   Develop the skills and computational proficiency for a reproducible data analysis workflow
>>>>>>> 94c63badeeec86099670eb2f26b0061996cdd280:slides/index.qmd

-   Develop proficiency using **professional statistical software** and using a reproducible workflow

-   Develop important non-technical skills, specifically **written communication and teamwork**

-   Identify **appropriate methods for the primary analysis objective** - inference or prediction

## Remainder of session

-   Tidymodels overview and demonstration

-   Hands-on activity with tidymodels and writing exercises

    -   **Goal:** Get a glimpse of the in-class student experience

-   Data, teamwork, and putting it all together

# Computing using tidymodels

# Tips and Lessons Learned

## Complex data

-   Use authentic data sets that require some wrangling
    -   Reinforces exploratory data analysis and that raw data is not always ready for analysis
    -   Extent of data wrangling differs based on type of assignment and time to complete it

. . .

-   Avoid using too many examples with violations in assumptions / regression not useful method for the data

## Resources for finding data

-   [OpenIntro](https://www.openintro.org/data/)

-   [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday)

-   FiveThirtyEight

    -   [GitHub repo](https://data.fivethirtyeight.com/)

    -   [R package](https://fivethirtyeight-r.netlify.app/)

-   [Data is Plural](https://www.data-is-plural.com/)

## Teamwork

- Teams of 3 or 4 students assigned based on
    -   statistics and computing experience
    -   major or academic interests
    -   each student has at least one potential point of connection

. . . 

-   Groups work together throughout the semester on weekly lab assignments and the final project

## Teamwork 

- Teamwork is assessed based on contribution and collaboration
    -   GitHub commit history on assignments to assess contribution 
    -   Periodic team feedback to assess collaboration

## Putting it all together

Some skills highlighted in 2014 ASA Curriculum Guidelines

It is important that students not only develop these skills but also how to use them in practice.
