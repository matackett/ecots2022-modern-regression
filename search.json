Innovating subsequent courses is also important, so students can continue developing these skills beyond the first course. In this session, we'll present a modern approach to teaching undergraduate regression analysis, the second statistics course for many students. We'll share strategies for using real-world data sets and examples, teaching modern computing skills, and incorporating non-technical skills such as writing and effective collaboration as part of the course. We'll share example activities and assignments, along with a demo of the computing toolkit using the R tidymodels package, Quarto for reproducible reports, and Git and GitHub for version control and collaboration. The activities and demo will be hands-on; attendees will also have the opportunity to exchange ideas and ask questions throughout the session.\n\n\nPresenters\n\nDr. Maria Tackett is …\n\n\nDr. Mine Çetinkaya-Rundel (she/her) is Professor of the Practice and Director of Undergraduate Studies at the Department of Statistical Science at Duke University. Mine’s work focuses on innovation in statistics and data science pedagogy, with an emphasis on computing, reproducible research, student-centered learning, and open-source education as well as pedagogical approaches for enhancing retention of women and under-represented minorities in STEM.
