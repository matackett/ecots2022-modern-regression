# Background & Motivation


## 2014 ASA Curriculum Guidelines for Undergradaute Programs in Statistical Science

*"...concepts and approaches for working with **complex data**...and analyzing non-textbook data."*

<br> 

*"...students' analyses "should be undertaken in a **well-documented and reproducible way**"*

<br> 

*"...construct effective visual displays and **compelling written summaries**" and "demonstrate ability to **collaborate in teams**..."*

## What we learned from projects...

-   Final projects in class
-   Noticed gaps

## Inspired by introductory courses

**Goal:** Create learning experiences to continue cultivating these skills beyond the intro course

## Why the second course?

- Why this course?

    -   Often the second course for many students
    -   Serves a diverse student population
    -   First shared course for statistics majors
    -   Develop skills early that can be built on in later courses
    

## The Course

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
- 90+ students who have taken introductory statistics, data science, or probability course
-   **Topics:** Linear regression, logistic regression, special topics, with focus on application
-   **Activities:** Active lectures with in-class exercises, computing labs, homework, quizzes/exams, group project

## Modernizing the course

- Regularly engage with **real-world applications and data** that require some wrangling

- Develop proficiency using **professional statistical software** and using a reproducible workflow

- Develop important non-technical skills, specifically **written communication and teamwork**

- Understand determine **appropriate methods for the primary analysis objective** - inference or prediction

# Computing using tidymodels

# Tips and Lessons Learned

## Tips for finding authentic data

## Finding authentic data

## Teamwork in the course

*"demonstrate ability to **collaborate in teams**..."* 

- Groups of 3 or 4 students assigned early in the semester
  - statistics and computing experience
  - major or academic interests 
  - each student has at least one potential point of connection

- Groups work together throughout the semester on weekly lab assignments and the final project 

- Assessed on contribution and collaboration 
  - GitHub commit history on assignments
  - Periodic team feedback 
  
## Writing & communication 

*"...construct effective visual displays and **compelling written summaries**"*

**Two components**

- Writing accurate interpretations that are meaningful in practice
- Produce well-structured and neatly formatted document 
  - Includes headers, narrative, tables, and visualizations
  
## Writing & communication 

- Students provided scaffolded documents 
  - By final project, students receive essentially blank document 
  
- Writing activity **see google slides**

## Challenges & lessons learned

-   Important for students to understand how to put everything together
    -   value of the project
