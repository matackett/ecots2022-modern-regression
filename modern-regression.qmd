## Session agenda

-   Background & Motivation
-   Computing with tidymodels
-   Demonstration
-   Tips and lessons learned

# Background & Motivation

## Statistics curriculum guidelines

**GAISE**

-   "..emphasize the practical problem-solving skills that are necessary to answer statistical questions." - GAISE

**Curriculum Guidelines for Undergraduate Programs in Statistical Science**

-   "concepts and approaches for working with complex data...and analyzing non-textbook data"

-   facile with professional statistical software" and that students' analyses "should be undertaken in a well-documented and reproducible way"

-   "write clearly, speak fluently, and construct effective visual displays and compelling written summaries" and "demonstrate ability to collaborate in teams and to organize and manage projects"

## Observations from projects

-   Final projects in class
-   Noticed gaps

## Innovations at introductory level

-   Modernizing intro statistics classes
-   Development of intro data science classes
    -   data science in a box

## Motivation

-   **Goal:** Create learning experiences to continue cultivating these skills beyond the intro course

-   Why this course?

    -   Often the second course for many students
    -   Serves a diverse student population
    -   First shared course for statistics majors
    -   Develop skills early that can be built on in later courses

## The Course

::: columns
::: {.column width="60%"}
-   \~ 90 - 100 students who have taken introductory statistics, data science, or probability course
-   **Topics:** Linear regression, logistic regression, and ANOVA with focus on application
-   **Activities:** Active lectures with in-class exercises, computing labs, homework, quizzes/exams, group project

## Modernizing the course

-   Regularly engage with complex \[and relevant\] real-world data and applications\*

-   Develop the skills and computational proficiency for a reproducible data analysis workflow\*

-   Develop important non-technical skills, specifically written communication and teamwork

-   Use regression for prediction and inference and determine appropriate methods based on analysis objective
